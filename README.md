# ProjetTD-AC

This paper presents *TD-AC* which is an effective algorithm for the truth discovery problem \emph{when the attributes over data are structurally correlated}. We build our procedure on an abstract representation of the truth in the data, the k-means clustering technique and the silhouette measure to automatically find  an optimal partitioning of the input data (or a near-optimal) maximizing the accuracy of any \emph{base} truth discovery process. The intensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real datasets show that TD-AC outperforms existing  partitioning approaches with a more reasonable running time. It improves on synthetic datasets the accuracy of standard truth discovery algorithms by $6\%$ at least and by $16\%$  at most and also significantly when the data coverage rate is high for the other types of datasets.
